# JollyWoo

JollyWoo is a fun and educational channel that helps kids learn through engaging songs, dances, and creative hacks. With
the playful duo of Hand Jolly and Brain Woo, learning becomes easy and entertaining for children of all ages. Whether
itâ€™s discovering new games, laughing at funny jokes, or exploring cool tricks, JollyWoo makes every moment enjoyable!

I participated in the creation of the early episodes of JollyWoo, working on character design and drawing various
objects.
