# Royal Mint

Royal Mint by John LoStark is a visual novel that immerses players in a realm where dragons reign supreme, weaving a
story of intrigue, ancient power struggles, and deep-rooted mysteries.

I created the game’s characters, various props, in-game elements, and some locations, drawing inspiration from the
concept artist’s designs and ensuring that each one reflects their unique traits and role in the story.

Some character examples. From concept art to sketch and render.
