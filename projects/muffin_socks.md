# Muffin Socks

Muffin Socks is an educational channel that helps kids learn through fun and engaging songs. It makes learning easy and
enjoyable for children in nursery, kindergarten, and early school with simple, catchy tunes.

I created the backgrounds for this animated project, designing all illustrations in vector format with
animation-friendly considerations. Each element was built to support seamless integration into the animation pipeline,
making it easier for animators to work with.
